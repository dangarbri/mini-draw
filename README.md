# Mini Draw
Welcome to mini draw, a C++ SDL-based graphics library.

## What is Mini Draw?
Mini Draw is an SDL-based framework for writing graphical
applications (i.e. games). It provides automatic SDL
initialization, some memory management, and APIs for
loading images, fonts, and rendering them on the screen.
These APIs allow for you to focus on your application code,
rather than dealing with managing SDL\_Textures, and TTF\_fonts
directly.

## Feature Set
- Image loading and freeing
- Font loading and freeing
- Animation by specifying multiple images that make up the animation
- Positioning, Rotating, and Scaling API
- Organized Program Flow (Startup, Frame Update, Shutdown)
- Programmable Animations via Cubic Bezier curves
- WASD keyboard movement built-in
- Fully documented, searchable API via doxygen
