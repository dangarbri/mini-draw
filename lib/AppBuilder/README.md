# App Builder
Source files here are nonessential to the framework and can
generally be removed from the library to reduce its size.

These are a collection of useful plugins/utility code that
can be "drag & dropped" into any application to help build
an app.

The current feature set is:
- WASD movement (up, left, down, right)
